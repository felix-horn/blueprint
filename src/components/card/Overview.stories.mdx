# Base Card

The base card component is used to display infromation for a single trimline, model, equipment option, etc.
A base card always shows a title on top and has a CTA at its bottom. Also, by clicking anywhere on the card (but the CTA) the card can be selected.
All other card content can be passed in as a child or as several children, which then are ordered vertically.

Content can just be any text but card content components are additionally provided to structure content within a card.

## Content Components

- StyledCardLayout can be used to layout several card children in rows, columns or a grid.
- TruncatedText can be used to line clamp longer text to only three line of text.
- Price formats any number to a locale specific format.
- Data Item structures and formats value, unit and label e.g. of technical data info.

## Usage guidelines

- Please use `theme.responsive.spacing.m` when placing multiple content cards
  next to each other or below/above each other.

### Best practices

- Use the content card when having a dense or functional layout for example in
  profile settings
- Place multiple optional interactive elements as buttons on the card to guide
  the user to a deeper level
- Use horizontal swiping to make mobile navigation easier and take advantage of
  the elevation of the card
- The card itself is never clickable or selectable
